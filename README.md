I have a real passion for all things cybersec, be it red, blue or purple teaming!!

Currently I am focused on the GRC aspect of things so that I can build my knowldge and be a better bridge between the technical and not so technical side of information security. 

I love to participate in CTF events so if anyone is looking for a team mate for such adventures, I'll be more than happy to link-up ✌️
